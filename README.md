In this repisitory you can find updated information about QTLs and genes associated with growth and meat traits in sheep. 
The database consists information about 156 SNP-trait associations (123 unique SNPs) and list of 165 associated genes (Ovis aries).
This information can be useful for further association studies and preliminary estimation of genetic variability for economically important traits in different breeds.

# Estimation of allele frequencies Romanov and  katahdin breeds 
We calculated the allele frequencies (AF) of 89 SNPs in the samples of 18 Romanovs and 6 katahdins maintained at the Ernst Institute of Animal Husbandry, and 10 Argalis collected in various places from Russia and Kyrgyzstan (see ST6). Both domestic breeds showed sufficient variability. Average minor allele frequency (MAF) was 0.22 for both breeds. Correlation between AF for these 89 SNPs was 0.54. On contrary, almost all SNPs were fixed in argalis (average MAF was 0.03).
