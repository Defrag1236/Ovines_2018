Supplementary tables from paper "Recent advances in understanding genetic variants associated with growth, carcass and meat productivity traits in sheep (Ovis aries): an update"


Hello!

In this repisitory you can find recent updated information about QTLs and genes associated with growth and meat traits in sheep. 
The database consists information about 156 SNP-trait associations (123 unique SNPs) and list of 165 associated genes.
This information can be useful for further association studies and preliminary estimation of genetic variability for economically important traits in different breeds.
